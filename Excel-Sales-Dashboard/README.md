  - Top Products by Revenue
- Slicers for Region, Category, OrderPriority, YearMonth
- KPI card: Total Revenue

## Steps
1. Imported CSV and formatted as Table (`SalesTbl`)
2. Added calculated columns  
   - `YearMonth = TEXT([@OrderDate],"yyyy-mm")`  
   - `NetSales = [@Quantity]*[@UnitPrice]*(1-[@Discount])`  
   - `DaysToShip = [@ShipDate]-[@OrderDate]`
3. Created PivotTables + charts and connected slicers  
4. Designed one-page dashboard and added KPI cards
